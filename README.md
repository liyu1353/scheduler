# Kpop Schedule
My first attempt at a web project, featuring
- Webscraping Weverse and other sites for new announcements
- Compiling the most important information from the announcements into a database
- Presenting the data in a calendar-like format
- Filter by region, so international fans won't have a ton of Korea-only stuff

More to come, perhaps?
